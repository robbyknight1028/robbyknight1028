Hello! My name is Robby Knight and this is my personal Github page.
I am a recent IUPUI graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
Any work you find on this page will either be past work from my schooling days,
or personal projects I am currently working on. This account is new as I am converting
from the IU Github to an official Github account.

You can reach me at my email rknight1028@gmail.com.
